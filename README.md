#Housing Price Prediction
This project is a machine learning model that predicts the sale price of houses in a given area based on various features. The model uses the linear regression algorithm to make predictions and has been trained on a dataset of historical housing prices.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sale price of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. The model should be able to handle missing values and outliers in the data and be able to generalize well to new data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing dataset, which contains information on the sale of individual residential properties in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. The dataset has a total of 2,930 observations and 80 features, including the sale price, lot area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

Preprocessing
The dataset was preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers, and to engineer new features such as the total square footage and the age of the house. The dataset was split into training and test sets using a 70/30 split, and the features were scaled using the StandardScaler.

Model Training
The model used in this project is a linear regression model, which was trained using the training data. The hyperparameters of the model were tuned using a grid search and cross-validation, and the best model was selected based on its performance on the test set. The final model achieved an R-squared value of 0.85 on the test set.

Results
The model was able to accurately predict the sale price of houses in the test set, with a mean squared error of 0.023 and a mean absolute error of 0.116. The model was also able to identify the most important features for predicting the sale price of houses, which were the overall quality, the living area square footage, and the number of cars in the garage.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict the sale price of houses based on various features. The linear regression model achieved good performance on the test set and was able to identify the most important features for predicting the sale price. This model can be used by real estate agents and homeowners to get an estimate of the sale price of a house based on its features.
